        <p>Hi! I go by John Winston. I am a computer scientist living in Athens, Alabama working at <a href="https://relational.ai/">RelationalAI</a> while finishing up my graduate degree in computer science at <a href="https://www.athens.edu/">Athens State University</a>.</p>

        <p>Recreational mathematics is one of my hobbies. In 2020, I discovered a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> pattern I named <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Doo-dah">Doo-dah</a>, later featured in <a href="https://siobhanroberts.com/about/">Siobhan Roberts’s</a> New York Times article <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/science/math-conway-game-of-life.html">“The Lasting Lessons of John Conway’s Game of Life”</a>. Since then, I have focused on using Doo-dah as a vector for <a href="https://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/bridges-2025-exhibition-of-mathematical-art/john-winston-garth">educational and artistic outreach</a>.</p>

                <p>After I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science, I landed an internship at NASA. During this time I worked in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System">Space Launch System</a> flight software simulation laboratory. I used the simulation data to <a href="https://youtu.be/hCvc1v0qGc8">recreate the flights</a> using the Unreal Engine.</p>

                <p>I was hired by the same department working as a contractor with Jacobs Technology. During this time I worked on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISS_ECLSS#Water_recovery_systems">Urine Processor Assembly</a> on board the International Space Station. The UPA converts the astronauts' urine into the water they drink, saving the cost of launching water into space. Here is a picture of me in the Mission Control Center in Houston, TX.</p>

        <p>I am currently obsessed with my new (used) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs19jqiYRUg">Portaball</a> telescope. I enjoy using my telescope for educational outreach. I am a lifetime member of the <a href="https://vbas.org/">Von Braun Astronomical Society</a> (where I volunteer), I have completed the <a href="https://www.astroleague.org/messier-observing-program/">Messier Observing Program</a>, and I have been building <a href="https://www.astronomyboy.com/eyepieces/">custom eyepieces</a>.</p>

        <p>I am passionate about my family and local history. I enjoy digitizing family letters and documents to share and preserve. I have extended this passion to working with the <a href="https://www.limestonecounty-al.gov/Departments/Archives">local county archives</a>. I am currently digitizing the county's microfilmed newspaper collection. I hope to use AI techniques to aid the local researchers learning about the area and their families.</p>
